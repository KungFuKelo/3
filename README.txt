# Book Management App

This is a small JavaScript application designed for practicing legacy JavaScript with pre-ES6 syntax. The application allows users to manage a list of books, including specifying the count of books and entering details for each book.

## Features

1. **Book Count Input:**
   - Users can input the count of books they want to manage (limited to 6).
   - Error handling is in place to validate the input.

2. **Book Details Input:**
   - Users can enter details for each book, including name, author, author's email, and price.
   - Input fields are validated to ensure proper data entry.

3. **Table View:**
   - After entering details for the specified number of books, the application displays a table view with the entered book details.
   - Users can edit or delete each book entry.

## Legacy JavaScript and Pre-ES6 Syntax

The code follows pre-ES6 JavaScript syntax, demonstrating older coding conventions and patterns. The use of functions, event listeners, and DOM manipulation is done using traditional methods.

## Usage

To use the application, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter the count of books, and then proceed to enter details for each book. Once all details are entered, the application will display the book entries in a table.

## Improvements

1. **Refactoring:**
   - The code could benefit from refactoring to adopt modern ES6+ syntax, making it more concise and readable.

2. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - The separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be improved for better maintainability.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Enhancements to the user interface can be made for a more user-friendly experience.

4. **Code Comments:**
   - Additional comments can be added to explain the code's functionality, especially in complex sections.
